The sun rises in the east
Birds sing early in the morning
A gentle breeze moves the trees
Nature feels calm and peaceful
The river flows slowly through the valley
Clouds drift quietly across the sky
Leaves fall softly onto the ground
The evening brings cool and fresh air
Stars appear one by one at night
Silence covers the land before sleep
